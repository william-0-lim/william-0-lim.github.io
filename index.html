            <p>A little bit about my myself:</p>
            <p>I believe being genuine and nurturing, along with professional and driven, 
              is an essential combination for people in my field. My abilities extend to problem-solving and critical thinking with proficiency in teamwork. 
              Working with people from diverse backgrounds has provided me with a deep understanding and awareness of differences in both individuals and organizations.
              I am also very hard-working who can create and support new or improved products from research through development as well as someone with a positive
              attitude and an adaptable, creative mindset. Also, I do have a passion for clean and beautiful code with an eye for simplicity and pragmatism.
              I also happen to love Football with a passion and loves to go outdoors for hikes and camping. :)
