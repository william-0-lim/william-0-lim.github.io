# William's Personal Portfolio Website. 

This is a project that I have started back in April 2021. It is my first personal project that I have done and it was when I was just starting to learn about 
Frontend which is why I have used HTML/CSS instead of fancy framework like React and Angular. It is updated as of Feb 2023 and it is still work in progress as I
do intend to make it more dashing and interesting! But the link to see the website is https://william-0-lim.github.io/ Thank you :)
